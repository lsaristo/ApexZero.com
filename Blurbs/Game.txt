1~Something we typically ignore when considering what is affecting our sleeping habits. It is not only what we are eating before bed but also how close to bedtime we are eating it that play a role in the quality of the following nights sleep.<br><br>There is a big myth that when you\''re sleeping, you don\''t need calories because your body isn\''t using any energy. The reality, however, is quite the opposite. Over the course of a full night of sleep, your body will burn approxiately the same number of calories as it would if you were sitting on the couch watching TV, plus or minus about a hundred. In other words, you save a slice of bread\''s worth of calories by sleeping. Consider, then, how many hours that you go without food during the night. For someone with diabetes, this can be especially problematic since your blood sugar throughout the night may fluctuate as a result of the long fasting period.<br><br>As you might suspect, it isn\''t the best idea to go to bed hungry. This doesn\''t mean to pig out on greasy fast food, however. Instead, <a href=\"http://time.com/3020266/you-asked-will-eating-before-bed-make-me-fat/\">it is suggested</a> that you choose something slow-burning, like a complex carbohydrate that will help maintain a stable blood sugar level throughout the night.
2~Alongside the smartphone, this one is probably the most common offender for people today. Light emitted from the tablet screen is not only abnormally bright to our eyes since it tends to be the only lightsource in a dark room and very close to our faces, but it also emits a wavelength of light that our eyes are particularly sensitive to for the purposes of regulating what time of day it is, a mechanism called the circadian rythym. The blue-ish wavelength of light emitted by most LED and flourescent LCD screen backlights stimulates the receptors in the eyes that feed the circadian clock. The result: it gets confused and thinks it is still the middle of the day, not midnight. <a href=\"http://jp.physoc.org/content/535/1/261.full\">Research has shown </a>that this light is responsible for supressing Melatonine, a neurotransmitter whose rapid onset at night and rapid decrease in the morning follow the sleep/wake cycle closely and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Circadian_rhythm\">is thought to be crucial to regulating the Circadian Rythym.</a> There are a few things you can do to mitigate the instrusion, however. One of the most important, and problably most obvious, is to avoid such stimulation before bed and to keep these distractions either out of the bedroom entirely, or switched off. Also, don\''t forget about that little green charging indicator light! In the complete darkness of the bedroom, these little indicators output much more light than you\''d think. 
3~This one is probably a bit more subtle to most people. While it is important for us to be comfortable in our bedroom to get a good night sleep, all too often--and especially if it is cold outside--we turn our heaters to a temperature too high. The daily rhythm of our body\''s changes in core temperature follow very closely to the Circadian rhythm. Therefore, it is essential to allow the body to be able to go into a sort of \''cool down\'' phase at sleep onset so it can properly reach a temperature minimum in the middle of the night. <br><br><a href=\"http://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/sleeping-when-it-blistering-hot\">Research</a>suggests that trying to sleep in an environment that is too hot can lead to difficulty falling asleep or maintaing sleep...in other words, the classic definition of insomnia! Moreover, the sleep that you do end up getting will involve less dreaming. Less dreaming means less time spent in the REM phase of sleep (Rapid Eye Movement, not the band!). Finally, lack of REM sleep means functions that REM sleep provides, such as the manipulation of emotions tied to memories and the consolidation of those memories will be affected.
4~One of the most common distractions to a good night\''s sleep is the laptop. In addition to the light being emitted from the laptop being a cue to our brain that it is not the proper time to sleep, the laptop is particlarly problematic because it is often directly in our faces and so a much higher proportion of the screens light reaches our eyes. Moreover, using the computer is typically one of the last things we do just before going to sleep.
5~This one is pretty common. Sleeping, or trying to sleep with a TV on can be problematic for a couple of reasons.First, the TV serves as a light source, which confuses our body\''s ability to discern when to sleep. Second, the light from the TV can be especially problematic because of the specific wavelengths emitted. Our body\''s light sensor contains cells in the retina that allow the brain to figure out what time of day it is. As it happens, these cells are particularly sensitive to the same wavelengths emitted by the fourescent or LED backlight in the TV screen.
6~This one is a common case that may be pretty obvious to some. Sleeping, or trying to sleep, with any light source nearby can affect how long it takes to fall asleep, as well as when you sleep and wake. The body\''s ability to know when it should sleep is affected in-part by external cues. Among these cues, light is the strongest. Therefore, exposure to artificial light sources can throw off the body clock and lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia, or Advanced or Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. <br><br>As mentioned in a couple of other distractor explanations, the mechanism that allows light to influence the body\''s daily sleep/wake cycle is particularly sensitive to light toward the ultraviolet spectrum. Specifically, it seems that white LED and fourescent lighting appears to have the strongest influence on Melatonine production which is indicative of Circadian rythym reglation. Therefore, in order to mitigate the effects of artificial lighting in the room late at night affecting the body\''s sleep/wake cycle, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-07/bedroom-invading-smartphones-jumble-body-s-sleep-rhythms.html\">it is suggested</a> that avoiding lightsources of those wavelengths is best. Using only standard incandescent bulbs, which output a much warmer red-ish light will have less of an affect on the body\''s regulating mechanisms than will a flourescent or LED bulb. Incidentally, recent pushes toward more cost-effective and \''green\'' solutions means that fewer standard incandescent bulbs are available as they are largely being phased out in favor of the very flourescent bulbs that can cause the problems metioned above. In order to mitigate their effect, manufacturers of these new bulbs often offer a variety of so-called \''color profiles\'' to choose from. Names such as \''soft white\'' or \''bright white\'' indicate the approximate color spectrum produced by the light of the bulb. A sleep-weary and wise consumer, then, should look for the choice that is closer to the warm orange glow of the standard incandescent bulb to avoid late-night bedtime reading from keeping him up rather than putting him to sleep! 
7~This one is a bit more interesting. New research suggests that, in addition to having a Circadian rhythm, we may also have a Lunar rhythm. That is, the moon can have an effect on our sleeping pattern. What\''s particularly interesting about this new research is that the moon continues to have an effect on people even when they\''re not directly exposed to it and therefore discounts the most obvious explanation that the moon\''s light is the cause of this interaction. 
8~Another commonly misunderstood mechanism for affecting our sleep is alcohol. It is commonly believed that, because it is a sedative, drinking alcohol before bed should only serve to make for a better night\''s rest. While it is true that drinking before bed can aid in allowing someone to fall asleep faster and sleep more \''deeply\'' overall, the type of sleep you end up getting is not as beneficial as you might think.<br><br>Consuming alcohol before bed results in an overall increase in Slow Wave Sleep, or SWS. This phase of sleep in a subcategory of Non-REM sleep which means there is no dreaming activity during time spent in this phase. Typically, we alternate between Non-REM and REM sleep throughout the night in a periodic cycle of about 90 minutes. With the consumption of alcohol, however, we spend much more time in the deepest parts of Non-REM sleep, SWS. While Slow Wave Sleep is beneficial for consolidating certain types of declarative memories, it is only part of a larger memory consolidation and emotional regulation system that takes place during the night\''s different phases of sleep.<br><br>The end result, then, of consuming alcohol before bed is too much time spent in only one area of sleep with the result being that we will therefore miss out on the critical processes that occur only during the other phases of sleep. The lesson of this story? No more alcohol-induced sleep comas!
