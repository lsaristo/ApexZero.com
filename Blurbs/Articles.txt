The next time you try to rationalize staying up to finish binge watching the latest craze by telling yourself you'll simply make up for it by sleeping in late another day should take heed to this. New research suggests that chronic sleep deprivation speeds up the aging process in the brain. And we\'' not just talking about strictly cognitive impairments, but actual physiological changes.  <br><br>The research focuses on older adults, age 55 and over. In short, the evidence suggests that the brain atrophies more rapidly with each and every hour of deprivation. See the full article below

It is already known that our memory system is hardly perfect. Importantly, what we think we remember is partly at the whim of external influence. New research has now linked lack of sleep with an increase in susceptibility to external cues influencing what we remember about an event.

It\''s 2:30 in the afernoon and you have just finished polishing off that last slice of your lunchtime pizza. The problem: now you have to go to class and sit through a 2 hour lecture in a cramped and stuffy classroom. We\''ve all been there, and we all know we want nothing more than to curl up in bed instead of trying to force ourselves to stay awake in our seat.<br><br>The midday slump is largely a function of our body\''s natural circadian rhythym. The same mechanism that makes us sleepy before bed actually has the same influence around the middle of the day, allbeit less pronounced.<br><br>While the effect is largely biological, we tend to do a lot of things that exacerbate its effects. Read the full story below to learn of some simple techniques you can employ to avoid the groggy feelings next time you\''re stuck with a midday lecture.

It may come as some surprise to you, or perhaps as no surprise at all that when you\''re sick, you don\''t sleep well. It is often thought that whatever infection has taken hold of you is the culprit for our inability to sleep well during our sickness. A new perspective on this issue, however, is that it is not the sickness itself, but rather the body\''s immune response against it that is responsible for our lousy sleep.

Okay, perhaps the title is a bit misleading. I can\''t say that you will automatically lose weight by sleeping more. New research consolidates previous work and gives us a more comprehensive overview of the effects of sleep deprivation and body weight. The takeaway? There is now \''compelling evidence\'' that children who are chronically sleep deprived have a higher incidence of suffering from obesity or other related conditions.<br><br>To many people, this may seem counterintuitive. Afterall, when you\''re sleeping, you\''re not using energy and therefore, children who get less sleep should seem to be better off in the weight department. There is, however, a common misconception that we burn far fewer calories when we are sleeping versus when we are just sitting on the couch watching TV. The actual data tells us, however, that this is simply not the case. Infact, the differences in the number of calories burned by a night of sleep versus a night of so-called \''quiet wake\'' is roughly equivalent to what is contained in a piece of bread!

Okay, the title may be setting the story up for a bit of a letdown so let me start by saying NO, your head won\''t explode. I know, bummer, right?<br><br>Exploding Head Syndome is a type of Parasomnia. That is to say, that it is a sleep disorder affecting what people do in their sleep. Other sleep disorders such as night terrors, REM behavior disorder, and the all-too-familiar sleepwalking. Read about the full condition in the article below.

A new study suggests that a newborns\'' tendency to want to often breastfeed in the middle of the night is actually an attempt to ward off the possibility that the infant\''s mother will have another child anytime soon!

There are two primary classifications of sleep disorders: parasomnias and dysomnias. The former involves unwanted behaviors during sleep; perhaps the most classic example being sleepwalking. The latter involves the difficulty of initiating of maintaining sleep, with insomnia being the classic example. Sleep disorders range from the mildly bizarre to downright dangerous. What'\\s more, many people who suffer from a sleep disorder aren\''t aware of it. Instead, they only feel the effects of the disorder, such as chronic fatigue during the day from a poor night\''s rest.<br><br>See the linked Wikipedia article below for more information and to see if any of them sound like familiar territory for your own sleeping habits.

This country\''s most consumed narcotic. Caffeine is especially abundant in college students trying to stay awake to cram for that upcoming exam. Not only does sleep depriving yourself have deleterious effects on your ability to later recall the information that you\''re trying desperately to remember, the affects of the caffeine you use to keep yourself awake can also play a role in the quality of your memory come test day. Caffeine\''s effects on memory is a complicated beast and there isn\''t a clear right or wrong answer to whether to avoid it outright. However, there are some useful insights into when caffeine can benefit your studying and when it can lead to a lower test score.

While effects of the 24 cycle have been well known in influencing the circadian rythym, new research is shedding light on the less understood effects that the moon has on our daily rythym.  Specifically, it has been shown that the moon\''s position in its own cycle can affect when and how much we sleep. Moreover, and more perplexing, these effects have been shown even when the visual cues of the moon\''s position were removed.

It it well known that our body\''s biological processes follow a regular (mostly) daily cycle. The controlling mechanism for this cycle is called the circadian rhythym. Simply put, we follow a daily cycle of sleep and wake, along with the ramping up and slowing down of assorted biological processes. This ryhthym is so deeply innate to our biology, that we can follow it without any external cues about what time of day it is (though things do get a bit more complicated as it turns out, this rythym is naturally NOT subject to a 24 hour cycle, but rather, closer to 25 when left alone to its own devices, also referred to as the \'' free-running period\'').

Along with other biological processes, our body\''s core temperature fluctuates throughout the day in a predictable and cyclical manner. This has many implications for sleep quality, especially for people who frequently travel long distances. The effect they are surely familiar with, called jetlag, is partly determined by when in the traveler\''s daily cycle he is explosed to the conflicting cues of time of day. Specifically, it is suggested that the position of the traveler\''s daily temperature cycle plays a role in determining whether the body\''s circadian rythym will be advanced or delayed by the conflicting input and seems to depend on whether or not the cues were received before or after the body\''s natural temperature minimum, typically ocurring in the middle of the night, around 4am.

To regulate the body\''s daily cycle, the systems that control the circadian rythym must have some way of knowing what time of time it is. Without any external cues, we enter what is known as a \''free running period\'' which is our body\''s natural daily rythym of about 25 hours. External cues as to the time of day force this cycle to become aligned with the 24 daily light dark cycle, a process known as entrainment. There are a number of cues that allow our body\''s to entrain, these cues are called zeitgebers. The most influential of them, however, is light. Deep seeting in our psyiology, we are preprogrammed to respond to light cues and for those cues to ultimately affect when we feel sleepy. Special cells in the retina of our eyes are sensitive to a specific band of the visible light spectrum much like the rods and cones also in our retina are that allow us to see. These cells are different from the rods and cones, however, in that they do not transmit the light information to the brain\''s visual cortex for processing. Rather, they transit their light information directly to a region known as the Suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN. This region of the brain plays a central role in controlling the daily cycle of sleep and wake.
